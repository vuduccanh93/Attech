
Existing Functionalities
1)      perform PD analysis of ADS- B and radar stations. 
2)      Plot flight profiles based on radar and ADS-B surveillance data 
3)      Display of NUC value of each aircraft
4)      Simulate coverage analysis based on terrain information 
 
Wish List
1)      System to auto detect of flights with abnormalities such as positioning error, multiple ads-b tracks , jumping NUC and low NUC issue and to keep a history records of these flights 
2)      System to auto generate of PD analysis on a daily basis 
3)      System to auto generate PD analysis with multiple ADS-B stations and RADAR stations simultaneously
4)      Superimpose PD analysis on a FIR map and also Google earth 
5)      Generate statistics of aircraft avionics such as percentage of DO260,DO260A and DO260-B equipage
6)      Generate PD using SBS kinetics ADS-B receiver
7)      Plot actual coverage using SBS kinetics ADS-B receiver 
8)      Ability to input new buildings and infrastructures information to existing terrain data
